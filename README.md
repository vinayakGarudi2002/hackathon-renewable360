Renewable360: A Platform for Transitioning Communities to Renewable Energy Sources

Our team, consisting of Vivek Dhanade, Safhan Shirgaonkar, and Saurabh Patil, participated in the Algorithm 7.0 Hackathon organized by AIKTC, Navi Mumbai, and presented Renewable360, a platform focused on renewable energy. The project aims to help customers and communities transition to renewable energy sources by providing solutions based on user-specific needs and affordability.

Renewable360 offers a range of renewable technologies, such as solar, bio, wind, and more, or a combination of these, to fulfill the user's particular needs. It also provides information about subsidies to make the move to renewable energy more cost-efficient.
